## Lab 27: Reddit Search Engine

![Reddit Search Example](./asset/reddit-search.png)

### Author: 
Catherine Looper

### Motivation

In this project, I built a frontend application containing two input fields: one for searching Reddit's subreddit topics, and the other for setting a limit (from 1 - 100) for how many results to be returned. In this application, I configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. I was able to create and render React components to the DOM, add event listeners to React components, and update React component state.

Additionally, this application will turn the topic form's input borders red in the event of a superagent.get request failure (any time that a 200 status code is not returned).
